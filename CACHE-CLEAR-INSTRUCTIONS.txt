CRITICAL: BROWSER CACHE MUST BE CLEARED FOR FIX 1f TO TAKE EFFECT
================================================================================

The browser is using CACHED JAVASCRIPT CODE that still has the old bug!

STEP 1: Stop Dev Server
  - Go to Terminal: "Start Development Server (RFPEZ Main App)"
  - Press Ctrl+C to stop

STEP 2: Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL!)
  Option A (Chrome/Edge): 
    - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
    - Select "Cached images and files"
    - Time range: "All time"
    - Click "Clear data"
  
  Option B (Hard refresh):
    - Press Ctrl+Shift+R multiple times
  
  Option C (Incognito/Private):
    - Open new incognito window
    - Navigate to localhost:3100

STEP 3: Restart Dev Server
  - Ctrl+Shift+P
  - "Tasks: Run Task"
  - "Start Development Server"
  - Wait for "webpack compiled successfully"

STEP 4: Test
  - Navigate to session with 10 messages
  - Hard refresh (Ctrl+R)
  - Check console logs

EXPECTED CONSOLE LOG:
  âœ… Messages set to state, total: 10
  í´ Promise callback executing - checking state: { messagesLength: 10, ... }
  â­ï¸ Skipping setMessages - session was restored while loading agent
  (Should NOT see: "âœ… Default agent loaded, setting messages")

WHAT FIX 1f DOES:
  Added check: if (messages.length > 0) return;
  This prevents clearing messages that were already restored!
